## Active Calculator!

You are going to create a new Github repositoriy called _active_calculator_. Clone/sync it down to your computer to `/adi/active_calculator/`. It will contain **5** activities:

- A main activity to select an action to perform
- An activity to perform addition (TextViews, EditText Numbers, and Buttons)
- An activity to perform subtraction (TextViews, EditText Numbers, and Buttons)
- An activity to perform multiplication (TextViews, EditText Numbers, and Buttons)
- An activity to perform division + show the remainder (TextViews, EditText Numbers, and Buttons)

You will use `Intent`s to switch between activities. *Optionally*, you can have the `MainActivity` display the most recent result on it. This will require using `getIntent()`, `putExtra()`, and `getTYPEExtra()`.
