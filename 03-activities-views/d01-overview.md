## Classes, Android Activity Lifecycle, and Views

We're going to take a look at a _real_ class that we can physically see and use: the `Activity` class in Android. We'll then create custom classes to store data and use them with an Android application. We'll render that data on screen using Android's `TextView` widget. You'll be able to practice what you've learned with a lab for an app that you'll be building in class.
