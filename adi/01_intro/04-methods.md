## Methods & Android Intro

Today we're going to review all of the content that we've learned this week. We'll then take some time to review **methods** and show how to accept _multiple arguments_. We'll specify how to _return_ different types (such as `String` and `int`). We'll briefly show you how to run an Android application on a physical device. You'll work together to build a console application on the meaning of life. You'll then be assigned a weekend challenge that you can do by yourself (but we recommend you work on together); this final challenge of the week will be worked on as homework and will push you to the limit.

#### Methods

* How to use different methods from other classes
* Why we specify the return type that a method will offer
* Defining methods to accept multiple arguments
* Practice writing advanced methods

#### Android Introduction

* Starting Android Studio
* Installing Homebrew
* Using `adb` to check for devices
* Creating an Android app
* How to **build** and _compile_ and then **run** an app on a real device

#### Meaning of Life

When we're ready, we'll jump into this lab!
