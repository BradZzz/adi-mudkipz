## Meaning of Life Lab

Break into teams. **One person codes.** _One person researches_. ***One person leads app design and user experience***. You're going to use the skills you've learned this week to build an app as a team. You'll need to self-assign roles. Your instructors will be available to answer questions as needed; _ask if you are unsure of something!_

#### Coder

- Work with everyone but make sure you're coding
- Take the lead in code design
- Create a Git repository called `meaning-of-life` and publish it.
- Find it on your Github profile (https://github.com/your-username) under repositories.
- Add/commit/sync like a baws.
- Share the link to your teammates and have them fork when the app is complete.

#### Researcher

- Research methods and problems that the team encounters
- Be the problem solver
- Not coding, but finding the answers to problem
- Actively researching how to do `x` and `y`

#### Designer

- Lead a team ideation session for five minutes with the following columns:
  - **user input/output code ideas**
  - **user prompts (text/design)**
  - **user expectations**, **awesomeness**
- Create user stories somewhere (whiteboard, table, sheet paper on walls)
- Work with everyone to make sure the user experience rocks!

## PROMPT

As a team, you are designed to create an application that describes the meaning of life based on different philosophers. A user must be able to use your console application to _view a list of every philosophy_ and to _enter in a value to see the description of any value_. Below is the list of philosophies that you must make available to users.

##### Hints

- You'll need `[]` of Strings that contain philosophies and descriptions.
- This app has at least _two_ primary screens that must be seen to users.
- You can design your app to run based on _console arguments_.
- You could also research how to use the `Scanner` class and the `Reader` class to [accept user input](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5287538/how-can-i-get-the-user-input-in-java).


## PRESENTATIONS

When done, each team will spend a few moments to present their application on the projector!
