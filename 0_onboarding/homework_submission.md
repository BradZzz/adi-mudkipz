## Homework Submission and Feedback

- Students will be provided feedback **only** for on-time homework submissions.
- **Homework must be submitted via pull request no later than Midnight CST.** Any work submitted past this deadline will *not* be counted.
- Students will be provided feedback through the [Garnet](https://garnet.wdidc.org/cohorts/18) program for homework assignments.
- If you run into an error or problem when submitting homework, you may [create an issue](https://github.com/ga-chicago/adi-mudkipz/issues) and we will answer it.

#### Homework Submission

  0. You will be assigned homework from a specific Git repository.
  1. Browse to `adi/name_of_your_project`
  2. `git add .` all of your changes to the Git purgatory.
  3. `git commit -m "your commit message"` to commit your changes from the Git purgatory into your branch.
  4. `git pull upstream master` to gather any changes from the base repository
  5. `git push origin master` to push your changes to your own fork!
  6. Inside of your fork, create a new **pull request**.
  7. Submit the pull request for your instructors to check!

That's all! We will practice this workflow during class repeatedly to get you comfortable with it.

#### Project Feedback

- For each project you will be provided written feedback on your application from your instructors.
- Students will present their project in a presentation and perform an in-class peer code review.
