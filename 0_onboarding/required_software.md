## Required Software

ADI requires specific software to use in class. We do this so each student is using the same development environment as each other. Please install the following software during orientation (or prior to class start). It is best to install each item in the order they are listed (otherwise errors *will* occur).

If you run into any problems installing this software, please alert an instructor or your producer.
