## Class Library
There is no class library, but we do offer free course resources on our class website: https://immersiveandroid.com. Your account has already been sent up, just log in with your General Assembly email and password: "generalassembly123". Don't forget to change your password after you log in! You will also be able to find your attendance records and homework results here.

#### Authentication
We require the use of Github for authentication. Github accounts are free! You can sign up for an account here: https://github.com/join

#### About the Github authentication
When you first browse to the application, you will be asked to authenticate with Github. Please select allow if you are prompted. You will be redirected to Github.com to authenticate on their secure (SSL) servers. After logging in, you will be redirected to the application to peruse the library.
