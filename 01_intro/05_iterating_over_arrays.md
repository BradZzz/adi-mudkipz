# Iterating Over Arrays

*After this lesson, you will be able to:*
- Iterate over an array
- find minimum, maximum values in an array
- handle fencepost problems
- tally the most frequently occuring item in an array
- prevent IndexOutOfBounds exceptions

## What is iterating over an array?

Iterating over an array is what we call code that looks at every item in an array.
For loops are the most common way to iterate over an array. We can write for loops
in many different ways in order to find out different things about an array.

Sometimes we'll only need to look at each element in an array one at a time.
sometimes we'll need to look at two elements at a time and compare them to each other.

Some problems, like finding the minimum or maximum element in an array, require
us to store extra information in variables outside of an array as we iterate over
it.

When we're iterating over an array we need to be careful to never access an index
that doesn't exist. Arrays always start at index `0` and and at `a.length - 1`.
No negative number is ever a valid index of an array. Empty arrays have a length
of zero and we can't access any index of an empty array.

Any time we access an index of an array that doesn't exist Java will throw an
`IndexOutOfBounds` exception when the programs run.

We'll show you here a collection of the most common ways to iterate over an array.

## Looking at one element at a time

This is the simplest way of iterating over an array. We write a for loop
that starts at `0` and goes while the value of `i` is less than the length
of the array.

Notice that this for loop correctly won't print anything out for an empty array.

```java
for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
  System.out.println(a[i]);
}
```

## Fencepost Problems

Sometimes we need to do special things at the beginning or end of when we're
iterating over an array.

Imagine a fence. A fence looks like this: `|=|=|=|=|'. This fence has five
fence posts and four, uh, pieces of fence.

There's a discrepency there! If we were writing a for loop to build a fence should
it run five times to place each fence post, or should it run four times to place
each piece of fence?

Consider this psuedo code that tries to place four pieces of fence:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
  placeFence();
  placePost();
}
```

The output of this code would build a fence like this: `=|=|=|=|`. There are
correctly four pieces of fence, but we're missing a fence post at the beginning!

If we switch the order of calling the `placeFence` and `placePost` methods then
we end up missing a fence post at the end of the fence.

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
  placePost();
  placeFence();
}
```
