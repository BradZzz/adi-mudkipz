## Collections


#### Lesson: Advanced Collections
*After this lesson, you will be able to:*
- Describe a dictionary vs a list vs a set
- Create and manipulate arrays and ArrayLists
- Define immutable vs mutable
- Work with for loops to iterate over collections
- Create and store unique data in HashMaps
- Get and Put data into HashMaps

#### Lab: Advanced Collections

You'll be writing functions in pairs that accept parameters that use combinations of control flow and multiple conditionals. Some of these functions will also require you to iterate over data collections (Arrays, ArrayLists and, Hash Maps).
