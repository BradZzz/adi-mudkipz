## Functions and Logic

Today we're going to learn how to re-use code! This will make life efficient. There's no need to reinvent the wheel, right? We'll discuss how to use **functions** so our code can be used more than once. We'll then visit logic again and touch on _if/else_ statements, _switch_ statements, and _loops_.


#### Functions and Scope

- Describe how parameters relate to functions
- Create and call a function that accepts parameters to solve a problem
- Return a value from a function
- Discuss **void** vs **types**

#### Logic in-depth

- Use if/else if/else conditionals to control program flow based on boolean conditions
- Use switch conditionals to control program flow based on explicit conditions
- Use comparison operators to evaluate and compare statements
- Use boolean logic (!, &&, ||) to combine and manipulate conditionals
- Loop over a code block one or more times
