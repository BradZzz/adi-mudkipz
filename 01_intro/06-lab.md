## Lab: Developer Documentation

This lab is broken into **3** group assignments. The first will have you use the `ArrayList` again. Next, you'll practice asking and answering questions that others will be able to understand. Finally, you'll learn a new class in Java and developer documentation to teach yourself the `StringBuilder`!


#### 1. Properly Asking for Help (30 minutes)

- Register for both a [GAQA](http://gaqa.herokuapp.com/) and **Stack Overflow** account
- Fill out your Stack Overflow profile details with as much detail as possible
- In a group, use developer documentation to research the `ArrayList` class
- Learn how to **add**, **find**, and **remove** elements within an ArrayList; if you don't get stuck, try **iterating** through items of the list or a different data collection class
- The first time you run into a problem, make your way to [GAQA](http://gaqa.herokuapp.com/)
- Review the contents of [Stack Overflow's 'How do I ask a good question?'](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)
- Come up with a question to help you answer the problem you and your group has run into and review your group's question to verify it's as clear as possible
- Post your question to GAQA!
- Your instructional staff will provide feedback to your question.

**Stack Overflow (10 minutes)**

In the past two weeks, you have likely run into a problem:

- Brainstorm common problems or errors that you and your group mates have encountered so far in class
- Research them on Stack Overflow
- Upvote answers and comments that you find helpful or insightful
